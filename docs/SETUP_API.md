######Installing the Colored Lights API (for Devs)######

1. Download codeChickenCore(CCC) from here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1279956-chickenbones-mods  Be sure to take a dev-version (it may work with src too, we Haven't tested that) AND make sure to take the right CCC-Version for your Minecraft-Version.

2. Download coloredLightsCore(CLC) here: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/1445251-1-7-10-beta-wip-colored-light-progress-and  You **DON'T** need the coloredLightsAPI, you need the normal mod!

3. Drop both(CLC and CCC) into your "path_to_working_dir/mods/" folder

4. Thats it ;)  Just Start your IDE and hit "Run-Client" (or whatever you named your Client RunConfig)


The API methods **may** be inaccessible for now, but they can be implemented relativly easily.  Someone should let me know if the API is even accessible... because I don't know ._. Message on the forums, and ask questions on 
IRC: irc.esper.net
